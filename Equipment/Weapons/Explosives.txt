Explosives affect creatures and objects in a 10-foot radius unless otherwise specified. Explosives can be thrown a 
number of feet equal to your Strength score * 5 (minimum 10 feet). Explosives typically have a saving throw the targets
can succeed to reduce or resist the explosives' effects. Unless stated otherwise, the DC for this saving throw is 10.

Creatures inside the blast radius of a grenade or explosive that deals ballistic damage are deafened until the start of
their next turn. This temporary deafness cannot be resisted.

*This weapon does not detonate until at least one creature enters its space or a space immediately adjacent to it.
** This weapon does not detonate until you spend 1 AP to do so.
