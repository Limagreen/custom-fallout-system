The rules for dual-wielding are simple:

1. To dual-wield a weapon it must have the onehanded and light properties.

2. While dual-wielding, the attack action still only allows for one attack and from one weapon.

3. While dual-wielding, you can only reload one of the weapons as part of your Reload action.

4. Attacks with dual-wielded weapons at long range automatically miss.

5. While dual-wielding, you can make one attack per turn without spending AP.
