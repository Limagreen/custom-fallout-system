Name				Property			Cost		Weight
Radiation Suit			Radiation Resistance		500 caps	6 lbs.
Advanced Radiation Suit		Radiation Immunity		1000 caps	8 lbs.

Due to the unique nature of a radiation suit's design, they do not allow you to wear headgear with them, and if you
are struck by a critical hit while wearing a radiation suit it is considered compromised.

A compromised radiation suit no longer provides its benefits until repaired, while a compromised advanced radiation
suit only grants radiation resistance until repaired (unless you are struck again by a critical hit, in which case
it provides no benefits).

To repair a radiation suit costs 5 adhesive, 5 cloth, 5 lead, 5 leather, and 5 plastic, as well as a DC 15 Intelligence
(Energysmith) check.
