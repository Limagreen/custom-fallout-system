You barter with pretty much anyone, but most people will be annoyed if you treat them like a trading post. Worse, they
might think you're a salesperson. 

Those willing to buy and sell - mostly merchants and store owners - will buy and sell anything, though they'll 
specialize and be much more interested in certain goods than others. The gun store might buy your brahmin meat, but
they care more about your plasma pistol.

Lastly, as a general rule, caravans of normal size will have about 1,000 caps on them trading, plus their goods. A
stationary store will have around 6,000-10,000.
