Using chems can grant powerful, even extreme benefits for short periods of time. However, doing so runs the risk of
becoming addicted to the chem in question. Once the effects of a chem wear off, your character makes an Endurance 
saving throw; the DC equals 10 + your current Exhaustion level.

On a failure, your character becomes addicted to the specific chem in question. While addicted to a chem, every time
you finish a long rest without having first taken another dose you must make the same Endurance saving throw as above.
On a failure, your Exhaustion level goes up by 1. Exhaustion gained this way can only be removed by taking another 
dose, which removes all levels immediately. If you succeed three of these saving throws in a row, you are no longer
addicted.

Other means to remove addiction include taking a dose of addictol and visiting a Doctor for rehabilitation. The rehab
process takes 2d4 days to complete and costs 100 caps for every day taken.
