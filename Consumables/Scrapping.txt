Along your travels you will encounter mountains and mountains of wonderful crap. This crap, or "junk," can be scrapped
for components used to craft and build just about everything from stimpaks to recon scopes. Scrapping is a delicate,
time-consuming process that requires you to set aside at least one whole hour at a workbench, or with a portable
scrapping kit if you have one. During this time you'll be able to scrap up to 3 items, collecting the components from
them as listed. Without any ranks in the Scrapper perk you can only collect steel, rubber, cloth, bone, plastic, 
leather, and concrete when scrapping.

There's a lot of crap out there, in various different forms of crappiness. So if you're ever looking for some 
particular crap, be sure to ask for it by name when you make your Luck (Loot) checks. This way your Overseer can keep
it in mind and not forget that item even exists. Because when I say there's a lot of crap on the list, I mean there's a
LOT of crap on the list.
