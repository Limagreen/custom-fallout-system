Quick Fallout Damage Rules (Make life easier when converting them)

These rules apply to both melee and ranged weapons of these classes. Certain weapons may have damage from multiple
classes, which will follow the rules of that class.
- Ex: An irradiated fire axe might do 1d8 ballistic damage and 1d10 radiation damage.

Unarmed Strikes and Improvised Weapons
- d4's (punch, kick, rock or piece of junk)
- Unarmed strikes can gain access to special moves
- Unarmed strikes using a weapon (not bare fists) will follow the rules for that weapon's class

Ballistic Weapons
- d6's for onehanded weapons and unarmed strikes
- d8's for twohanded weapons

Laser and Elemental Weapons
- d8's for onehanded weapons and unarmed strikes
- d10's for twohanded weapons
- Elemental refers to acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, and thunder damage

Plasma and Radiation Weapons
- d10's for onehanded weapons and unarmed strikes
- d12's for twohanded weapons
- Radiation weapons are unique in that they don't subtract hit points, but rather reduce hit point maximum.

Explosives
- d12's for thrown explosives (frag grenades, dynamite, pulse grenades, cryo grenades, etc.)
- d20's for launchers (missile launchers, fat man, etc.)

Certain weapons may also have special properties:
- A fire axe might provide a bonus to checks made to break down wooden doors and barriers.
- .357 Revolver: You treat damage die rolls of 1 or 2 as 3's.
-- .444 Bear-Killer (I have to make this a thing now, using HEAP rounds)
