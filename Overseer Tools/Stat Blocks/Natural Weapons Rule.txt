Whenever a creature relies on its natural weapons (biting, clawing, stinging) it is treated as a one handed unarmed
strike, meaning:
- The attack costs 2 AP
- The attack uses Strength as the to hit modifier
- The attack deals 1d4 + Strength modifier in ballistic damage

Some creatures deviate from this, in which case they will have special rules listed in their stat block.
