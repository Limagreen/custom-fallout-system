Sanity is a unique SPECIAL attribute only used in certain campaigns. In these campaigns your Overseer will start
your character with an additional 5 SPECIAL points. Like normal, you can set your Sanity and other SPECIAL scores as
low as 1 and as high as 10.

Sanity specifically refers to your mental well-being and resiliency to the bizarre, the stressful, and the 
incomprehensible. A character with low Sanity is more easily panicked, stressed, and may even be struggling with their
grip on reality. A high-Sanity character is stalwart and difficult to phase. They might still be unnerved or frightened
by something, but they keep their cool despite this.

In response to certain situations, your Overseer may require you to make a Sanity saving throw. On a success, you
handle things; on a failure, you're hit hard by what's happened. Failure also permanently reduces your Sanity score by
1. 

If this reduces your Sanity below 3, you gain an Insane perk point you can use to obtain an Insane perk and you can
no longer benefit from any Sane perks you have (see "Sanity Perks"). This is the only way you can gain Insane perks.
Additionally, you must roll for a form of madness, using a d8. On a 5-8 you suffer a Short-Term Madness, on a 2-4 you
suffer a Long-Term Madness, and on a 1 you suffer an Indefinite Madness. You then roll on the associated table to
determine the specifics of that madness. You suffer madness each time your Sanity is decreased to a value less than 3.
While your Sanity is > 3, you cannot benefit from any Insane perks you have. If your Sanity becomes >= 5, any madness
you are suffering ends.

Similarly, if your Sanity is reduced to 0, you completely succumb to the madness of the Wasteland. You become hostile
to all creatures and the Overseer treats your player character as an NPC from now on.

There are various circumstances that can provoke a Sanity saving throw, including:
- A member of the party or friendly creature is killed
- Becoming addicted to a chem
- Cannibalism (I mean, what do you expect from this?)
- Consecutively failing saving throws against a source of the frightened condition
- Killing a human in or out of combat
- Learning a difficult truth
- Witnessing something insane or horrifying
- You are reduced to 0 hit points but are resuscitated or succeed your Death saving throws

Certain things provoke a different kind of Sanity saving throw. On a success, you increase your Sanity score by 1,
following the above rules for any changes that might cause. These circumstances include:
- Gaining a pet dog (automatically succeeds).
- Being a good human.
- Performing a truly selfless act or being saved by such an act.
- Taking a shot of Thorazine (automatically succeeds).
- Consuming alcohol.
