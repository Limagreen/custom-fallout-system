*** Sane Perks ***

An Incomparable, Irreplaceable Will: You have advantage on all Sanity saving throws, but you can no longer increase
your Sanity. Your mind is an iron fortress, but iron is hard to come by these days, and repairs would take more time
than you have.

Equilibrium: Critical hits against you are converted into normal hits. Likewise, your critical hits become normal hits.
Surviving with your identity intact is all about maintaining balance in everything you do.

Just Lucky I'm Alive: When you fail a Sanity saving throw, you can choose to decrease your Luck score instead. You do
your best to simply count your blessings in the midst of all this...but you've only got so many blessings.

Pacifist: So long as you have not intentionally harmed or attempted to harm any creature during a combat, you 
automatically succeed the Sanity saving thrown when it ends. In a land of violence, your hands will stay clean.

Positive Thinking: You have advantage on Charisma checks, but disadvantage on Perception checks and your Passive
Perception is reduced by 5. Why stay on watch? You're sure everything will work out.

*** Insane Perks ***

Communistic Wisdom: True wisdom fosters true learning: you gain twice as many points from skill magazines and books. 
You refuse to barter, buy, or sell anything with other creatures, lest capitalism infest your soul. 

Arthurian Legend: You have advantage on melee attacks and their hits deal the maximum damage possible for their dice. 
Your honor as a knight demands you never again use chems, ranged weapons, or explosives. One day, you will unite the 
peoples of this great land.

Monster Hunter: You deal double damage to supernatural enemies and half damage to normal ones. Mortals are unwitting
pawns in a greater game; it is the monsters and demons of this world who must pay for their crimes.

The Scurrier: Your movement speed increases by 15 feet when wearing light armor. You can climb difficult surfaces,
including vertical walls, without needing to make an ability check. To survive like the radroach, you must become like
the radroach.

Vermin Lord: You can talk to rats and mole rats, who are no longer hostile to you; they can be persuaded to come to
your aid. Once per week, you can summon Vermin Supreme, an immortal and indestructible rat of gargantuan proportions,
to aid you in a single battle. Your children understand this new world
