XP rating rewards are based on the idea that a single character must obtain 10 rewards of the same rating as their 
character level to progress to the next level. This implies that a given XP rating is an appropriate reward for 
characters of the matching level, but this highly depends on the party and circumstances that generate the reward.

For parties of more than one character, the XP reward is divided out evenly among the party members. For example, a
party of 4 characters who receive a Rating 1 reward would each receive (20 / 4 = 5) 5 XP. If ever there is a remainder
when dividing the reward by the number of player characters, round the reward up to the nearest whole number. I.e. in
that same party of 4, each character would receive 9 XP from a Rating 2 reward (35 / 4 = 8.75).

*This rating is intended mostly for horde enemies, so that using such a threat wouldn't rapidly generate an extreme
amount of XP.
