*** King Arthur ***
King Arthur and his nameless attendant are NPCs that realized they're in a game world. Arthur is now on a quest to
slay enough enemies that his XP will raise him to a level sufficient to challenge the Overseer as the God of this 
world. The two humans use character rules and character sheets; they also know the player characters are PCs. The two 
are also privy to all the stuff from Breach - the radio masters, Dr. Garbage Can, the business radroaches, all of it. 
And they can freely access these things.

Arthur is the only one who talks, and openly mocks and ignores the fourth wall.

*** Santa ***
Shows up in a sleigh pulled by six radstags. If the player characters are good he'll give them all a chance to ask for
goodies. If the request is a lofty one (such as a missile launcher) that person succeed a difficult Loot or Miracle 
roll for Santa to have it.

If the players haven't been good, he reminds them he'll one day come for them, while patting his Anti-Material rifle
before heading off. Either way, he frequently complains of raiders filling up his Naughty List and how he has to keep
hunting them down.

It's questionable whether he's a deeply-addled old man, or the actual Santa, warped into a new form by the violence of
the wasteland.
