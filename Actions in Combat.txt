*** Attack (Varying AP) *** 
The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a club, firing a round from a 
gun, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee, ranged, thrown, or unarmed attack. See the "Making an Attack" section for the 
rules that govern attacks.

Different weapons use different SPECIAL scores as the modifier for the attack and damage rolls:
- Melee, Thrown, and Unarmed weapons use Strength
- Ranged weapons use Perception
- Weapons with the Finesse property may use Agility instead of the weapon's normal SPECIAL modifier.


*** Dodge (4 AP) ***
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack 
roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Agility saving throws with 
advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.


*** Grapple (3 AP) ***
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Grapple action. The target of your grapple must be
no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the
target by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) - the target chooses which ability they use. You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. 

If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and 
you can release the target whenever you like (no AP required). Grappled creatures the same size as you or one size 
larger can be used as three-quarters cover, and creatures one size smaller can be used as half cover, if you spend an
additional 2 AP after successfully grappling them. Using an unconscious creature for cover this way makes you heavily
encumbered (see condition).

Escaping a Grapple. 
A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must repeat the contest skill check against you and 
succeed.

Moving a Grappled Creature. 
When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but you are encumbered by doing so (your movement
speed decreases by 5 feet), unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.


*** Help (2 AP) ***
You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you 
aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes
the check before the start of your next turn and that you are proficient in the skill needed for the check, if any.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the 
target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before 
your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

You can only take the Help action once per turn.


*** Hide (3 AP) ***
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for 
hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section of Hiding
and Vision.


*** Move (2 AP) ***
When you take this action, you can move a distance equal to your movement speed. On a grid, each space is 5 feet, so a
movement speed of 15 feet would let you move 3 spaces for every 2 AP you spend. Your movement speed may change 
depending on the circumstances, such as if you are moving through difficult terrain or swimming instead of walking.


*** Opportunity and Overwatch Attacks (Varying AP) ***
These are a special kind of Attack action, which cannot be used during your turn, but CAN be used outside of your turn.

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike
is called an opportunity, or overwatch, attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your melee or unarmed reach. 
To make the opportunity attack, you must have enough AP remaining to make one melee or unarmed attack against the 
provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.

Creatures don't provoke an opportunity attack when someone or something else moves it. For example, you don't provoke 
an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

Overwatch attacks are similar, but instead occur when a creature moves within range of a ranged or thrown weapon, such 
as a 9mm pistol or throwing knife, and you have line of sight. To make the overwatch attack, you must have enough AP 
remaining to make one attack with the weapon you're wielding. You can only make one Overwatch attack each time the
provoking creature takes the Move action. So a creature that moves twice can be attacked twice, but if they move once 
they can only be attacked once. If multiple creatures make Overwatch attacks against the same target, they each attack
independently of each other.

Once again, creatures don't provoke an overwatch attack when someone or something else moves it. Additionally, if a
creature engages you in melee, then moves out of reach, any Overwatch attack you make against them during their 
first Move action has disadvantage.

For example, Lila is engaged in melee with a raider wielding a spear, when the raider decides to fall back to a 
different position on its turn. If Lila takes an Overwatch attack during the raider's first Move action, it has 
disadvantage. If the raider, however, takes a second Move action (to move another 15 feet away), Lila's Overwatch 
attack would not have disadvantage.


*** Ready (Varying AP) ***
Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can 
take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take 
in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the fiend
opens this door I'll detonate the satchel charge," and "If the super mutant steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your action right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.

*** Shove (3 AP) ***
Using the Shove action, you can shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. The target must be
no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by
the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) - the target chooses which ability they use. You 
succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated; if you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 
feet away from you.


*** Search (2 AP) ***
When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something, making a Perception (Detection) check.


*** Skill Check (3 AP) ***
Except at the Overseer's discretion, making an ability check during combat costs 3 AP.


*** Use an Object (3 AP) ***
You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. 
When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you
want to interact with more than one object on your turn.

Examples of using an object include:
- Throwing a grenade or deploying a mine
- Detonating a satchel charge
- Using a chem
- Applying a medical item like a Stimpak
- Performing a skill check on a object, such as making an attempt to pick a lock
- Slamming a door in someone's face
- Looting a chest or person
