Every creature has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the creature can walk in 1 Movement Action, which costs 
2 AP to perform. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. A
creature wearing no armor and not Encumbered or Heavily Encumbered (see "Encumberance") has +10 feet to its movement 
speed.

The following rules determine how far a creature can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

Travel Pace
While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. 
The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes 
characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.

Forced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that 
limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their 
pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour 
past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.
