When attacking a creature, you can spend 2 additional AP on the attack to target one of their limbs with disadvantage. 
You specify which limb you wish to target from the list below:

Leg: In addition to normal damage the target's movement speed is reduced by half (round up to the nearest 5 ft increment,
minimum reduction of 10 feet) until healed.
- If both legs have been hit this way, the target can only crawl for 5 feet when it uses the Move action and is always
  prone until healed.

Arm: In addition to normal damage the target drops whatever it is holding with this arm and cannot use it until healed.

Head: The target must make a DC 10 Endurance saving throw. On a failure, the attack becomes a critical hit.
