Action Points (AP) are a pool you draw from during combat to determine what, and how much you can do during your turn
in a single round of combat. For a full list of what you can do in combat, see "Actions in Combat" in the "General 
Rules" folder.

A creature's Action Points are simple to determine. Simply add 5 to the creature's Agility score modifier:
-> -4 + 5 = 1
-> 3 + 5 = 8
-> 0 + 5 = 5

Player characters are unique in that their AP pool is at minimum 5 points regardless of their Agility score. For 
example, a super mutant player character whose Agility score is 4 (modifier of -1) would still have 5 AP in their pool.
A character can still have fewer than 5 AP if a status effect directly tells them to lower their AP pool amount and
doing so would bring them to less than 5.
