A core part of wasteland life out on the range is scavenging. In the ruins, in the pockets of the dead, and even in the
dumpsters. Stuff needs other stuff to work, and you want working stuff don't you?

Whenever you choose to scavenge an object, room, battlefield, etc., you will make a Scavenging check (typically using
your Luck SPECIAL score). On a success, consult the following list based on what you're looking for:

Ammo found: 2d4
Caps found: 3d4
Components found: 2d4
Junk items found: Varies

Keep in mind, the above values are for randomized rewards. At the Overseer's discretion certain situations may award
a pre-defined amount, nothing, or more loot than you can carry! Similarly, in some cases the Overseer may determine
what kinds of items you will find (ammo, caps, junk...) and in others they may allow you to choose the item you find
specifically.
