An ability check tests a creature's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The Overseer calls 
for an ability check when a creature attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the 
outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the Overseer decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the 
difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical 
Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

Every time a player character succeeds on an ability check, each individual member of the party receives XP based on
the Difficulty Class. For DC 0-5 they gain 5 XP, for DC 6 - 10 they gain 10 XP, etc. The full breakdown is included in
the Typical Difficulty Classes table below.

Ability checks using Luck as their SPECIAL score do not award XP on a success, unless otherwise stated.

Task Difficulty	DC
Very easy		5	5 XP
Easy			10	10 XP
Medium			15	15 XP
Hard			20	20 XP
Very hard		25	25 XP
Nearly impossible	30	30 XP

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and 
penalties (such as your skill bonus), and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability
check is a success; the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the creature 
makes no progress toward the objective or the outcome is not exactly what the creature intended; there is a setback or
complication of some sort.
