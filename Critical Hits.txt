When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the 
attack's damage dice twice, thrice, or more depending on the critical hit multiplier of the weapon used and your perks.
Then add them together to get the total. Finally, add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll 
all the damage dice at once or roll your normal damage dice, then multiply the total by your critical hit multiplier.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a knife, roll 3d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your 
relevant ability modifier. If you had rank 1 of Bloody Mess, you would roll 4d4 instead of 1d4.

When you are hidden from a creature, the first attack you make against them is a critical hit if successful. This is
known as a "Sneak Attack Critical." After the first attack, hit or miss, you are revealed to the creature you are
attacking, unless an effect, piece of equipment, or set of circumstances dictates otherwise.
